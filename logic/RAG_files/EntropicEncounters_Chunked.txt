Exploring Inclusive Societies on Distant Worlds
Welcome to Entropic Encounters, an immersive and collaborative game
designed to explore the possibilities of building inclusive, resilient, and
sustainable futures by using Science Fiction Thinking.
In this game, you will embark on an interstellar journey, traveling to distant
planets where diverse societies have established and are thriving. Each of
these societies — born from the challenges faced by underrepresented
groups and marginalized communities on Earth — has developed unique
ways of overcoming adversity, fostering equity, and creating environments
where all individuals can flourish.
Entropic Encounters is more than just a game — it is an opportunity to
unlock new narratives, inspire innovative thinking, and contribute to the
ongoing conversation about creating a just and equitable future for all.

Entropic Encounters is based on the
idea of Science Fiction Thinking.
Where does the name „Entropic
Encounters“ come from?
Science Fiction Thinking is a creative
approach to exploring future possibilities
by imagining and analyzing speculative
scenarios that often involve advanced technologies,
alternative social structures, and
otherworldly environments. It
leverages the imaginative and boundary-pushing
nature of science fiction to challenge
existing assumptions, inspire innovative
solutions, and explore the ethical,
cultural, and societal implications of
future developments. Science Fiction
Thinking helps us better understand the
complexities of our present world and
encourages us to think critically and
creatively about new paths.
Entropic Encounters refers to
experiences where participants explore
and learn from societies facing change,
complexity, or even chaos. The term
"entropy" is used to describe the natural
tendency of systems to move from order
to disorder. In this game, participants
engage with extraterrestrial civilizations
that have either embraced or overcome
these challenges. The encounters focus
on how these societies adapt, maintain
stability, or find new ways to thrive in
unpredictable environments, offering
valuable
insights into resilience,
innovation, and the dynamics of change.

Learning Goals
The primary goal of Entropic
Encounters is to engage participants
in thoughtful dialogue and creative
world-building, encouraging them to
consider how the principles and
innovations of these alternative
societies might be applied to our own world.
Fostering Inclusivity: Understand how inclusive
design and practices can create environments where
all individuals, regardless of their abilities or
backgrounds, are valued and empowered to contribute.
Through role-playing as both explorers
and celestial citizens, participants will
delve into the intricacies of these
societies, jointly imagining their social
structures, technologies, and cultural practices.
Encouraging Innovative Thinking: Inspire participants
to think outside the box by exploring how futuristic and
science fiction scenarios can lead to new solutions for
contemporary issues.
The game challenges participants to
think critically about inclusivity, equity,
and sustainability, and to experience
how diverse perspectives can shape a
better future.
Promoting Equity: Explore how different societies
address and overcome historical and systemic
inequalities, and consider how these approaches can
be applied to real-world challenges.
Connecting Fiction to Reality: Draw parallels
between the fictional societies encountered in the
game and real-world communities, reflecting on how
lessons learned can be translated into practical action.
Understanding Diversity: Gain a deeper appreciation
for the value of diversity in all its forms—cognitive,
physical, cultural—and how it can lead to stronger,
more adaptable societies.

Entropic Encounters is a game designed to inspire creative thinking, promote diversity, and
explore the possibilities of building inclusive and equitable societies. The game encourages
participants to engage with concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion through the lens of
science fiction. It is important to emphasize that the game is in no way intended to harm,
marginalize, or discriminate against any individual or group.
The term ”celestial citizens" is used within the context of the game as a creative tool to
represent fictional societies from distant planets. When designing the game, I tried to avoid
the term “alien” as it can carry negative connotations and evoke stereotypes of otherness or
exclusion. Instead, the celestial citizens are designed to reflect the diverse experiences,
strengths, and resilience of marginalized communities in our own world, celebrating their
contributions and exploring how their perspectives can shape better futures for all.
We recognize and respect the diversity of all participants and their experiences. Entropic
Encounters is committed to providing a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for
everyone. We encourage open dialogue, mutual respect, and sensitivity throughout the
game. If any aspect of the game causes discomfort or raises concerns, we invite participants
to share their thoughts with the facilitators so that we can address them appropriately.
The goal of Entropic Encounters is to open up new ways of thinking about diversity and
inclusion, fostering empathy, understanding, and collaboration.
We hope that this game will serve as a positive and enlightening experience for all involved,
contributing to the ongoing conversation about creating a just and equitable world.

Game Plan;Different Steps of the Game
Phase 1: Starting the Mission
Step 1: Build teams (2-4 people)
Step 2: Decide who will be the explorer(s) and who will represent the celestial citizen(s).
Step 3: All groups receive the Planetary Fact Sheets and the Briefings on the Celestial Citizens.
Step 4: Explorers, decide which planet you want to travel to; Celestial citizens, decide which society you want to represent.
Phase 2: The Encounter Begins
Based on the choice of the explorers (planet) and the
celestial citizens (society), take the sheet for the opening
monologue and start the encounter: The celestial citizens
welcome the explorers by reading out the opening
monologue.
Phase 3: Learning about the Society
The explorers initiate the conversation by asking the guiding
questions provided. Celestial citizens respond using the
thought prompts to share details about their society’s values,
challenges, and achievements.
Explorers should focus on understanding how the celestial
society has adapted to its environment, how it fosters
inclusivity and resilience, and what challenges it has overcome.
Celestial citizens should share their experiences of overcoming
Earth-based challenges and how they’ve built a thriving society
in their new world.
Phase 4: Synthesis of Insights
After the conversation, both the explorers and celestial citizens
take a few minutes to individually reflect on the dialogue. What
were the most impactful insights? How do these insights relate
to Earth’s current challenges?
Step 1: Collaborative Synthesis
The group (explorers and celestial citizens together) reconvenes
to discuss and consolidate the insights gained. The goal is to
distill these into three key recommendations or solutions that
could help address challenges on Earth.

General Mission Briefing:
Planet Earth stands at a critical crossroads. The impacts of climate change have become
severe, hitting different regions with unprecedented challenges. Yet, despite the urgency, the
same privileged voices dominate decision-making, stifling innovation and leaving many
potential solutions unexplored. The need for new perspectives, fresh ideas, and inclusive
approaches has never been more pressing.
In response to this crisis, humanity has launched a bold mission: to seek out new solutions
beyond Earth’s boundaries. We believe that on distant planets—where diverse societies have
faced and overcome their own environmental challenges—lies the inspiration and knowledge
we need to adapt and thrive back home.
The World Council for Climate Adaptation has assembled a group of courageous and curious
explorers for a groundbreaking mission and journey to three distant planets, each home to a
society founded by former Earthlings who once belonged to marginalized or underrepresented
groups. These pioneers, who left Earth seeking a new way of life, have since established
thriving communities in harsh, unforgiving environments. Their remarkable ability to adapt and
innovate has allowed them to overcome the challenges of their new worlds.
